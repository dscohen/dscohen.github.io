I am a postdoctoral researcher in the AI Lab at Brown University. Having spent my PhD on neural retrieval methods for less than desirable datasets (imbalanced data, noisy and/or sparse labels), my recent interests have focused on formally measuring this impact within our models -- capturing, measuring, and minimizing uncertainty. 

Prior to Brown, I received my Ph.D. from the College of Information and Computer Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst under direction of W. Bruce Croft.
